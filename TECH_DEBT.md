## 🔴 Bare Except [MEDIUM]

**Location:** `app.py:767`
**Priority Score:** N/A
**Effort to Fix:** MINUTES

### Problem
Bare `except:` clauses catch all exceptions including SystemExit, hiding bugs.

### Fix
Specify the exact exception types you expect to catch.

### Steps
1. Identify what exceptions `risky_operation()` can raise
2. Replace bare `except:` with specific exception types
3. Add appropriate logging inside the except block
4. Decide: should the exception propagate or be handled?
5. Never use `pass` silently — always log or re-raise

### Testing
Write a test that triggers the exception and verify the specific exception type is caught correctly
